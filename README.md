# Dart-Week-1
This is the assignment for Dart Week 1
It covers the following areas:
1. Variables- containers that store data. Declared using keywors such as 'var'(can be changed) or 'final'(a constant value)

2. Functions- A function is a reusable block of code that is designed to perform a specific task. The function can take an input, process the input and return the result.

3. If...Else control flow- It enables the execution of specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. The program can respond dynamically to different inputs or situations.

4. Switch...Case control flow- Is used to execute one block of code out of multiple possible blocks, based on the value of an expression.

5. Loops- These are control structures that enable you to execute a block of code multiple times based on certain conditions. They are used for automating repetitive tasks.
    
    1. For loop- checks a condition before executing.
    
    2. While loop- checks a condition before executing
    
    3. Do...While loop- This loop executes then checks a condition. It will execute at least once, regardless of the condition.

6. The Complex Example shows the application of data types and the use of control flows in the program.

    1. The For loop iterates through a list of integers and prints the number.

    2. The If...Else statements check if the number is odd or even and prints the output.

    3. The Switch statements categorize the number as 'small', 'medium', or 'large' and prints the output.
